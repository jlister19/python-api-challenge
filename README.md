Submitting 1 config file for each project that each have a blank API keys (api_key=""). Please use your own api key. I tried to update my gitignore file but it didn't seem to hide the appearance of the config files. So I removed the keys and left the files in the folders with the code fiels. This is the approach that was recommended by a TA to prevent issues and expsing api keys on GitHub. Thank you.
